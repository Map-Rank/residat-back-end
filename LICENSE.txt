The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. Here is the text of the AGPL license:

```
GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License, and "the AGPLv3" refers to version 3 of the Affero General Public License.

"The GNU Affero General Public License" refers to the version 3 of the Affero General Public License.

"Program" refers to any work licensed under this License. A "Modified Version" of a program refers to any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

"User Products" refers to any products, tangible or intangible, produced from the Program.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Program, and, in the modifications, a work that uses the Program is either a User Product (which is not itself a Covered Work) or an executable work that has been accompanied by a version of the Corresponding Source in accord with subsection 6b of the GNU GPL for another purpose, this License does not apply to the other works insofar as they are governed by separate terms and conditions. For some parts of the covered work, you have obligations under the GNU GPL in accord with subsection 7 of the GNU GPL. (One practical advantage of this arrangement is that you can use GPLv3-compatible licensing terms for the bulk of a User Product, but still use the AGPLv3 for the parts that are specific to network interaction.)

Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

A. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

B. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

C. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

D. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

E. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge
